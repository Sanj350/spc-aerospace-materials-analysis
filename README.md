Statistical Process Control on Aerospace Material and Shape

This project applies Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques to evaluate the stability and reliability of aerospace structural materials and shapes.
It focuses on tensile strength, yield strength, deflection (Young’s Modulus), and thickness for materials such as Aluminum, Carbon Fiber, and Titanium, across tapered, cylindrical, and rectangular shapes.

This analysis was completed for ISYE coursework and demonstrates the role of SPC in aerospace quality assurance.

🔍 Objectives

Evaluate the stability of tensile, yield, and elastic properties

Compare SPC behavior across materials

Analyze SPC behavior across structural shapes

Use X̄–R charts, EWMA, and CUSUM to detect process stability

Integrate material + shape combinations (e.g., Aluminum + Cylinder)

📊 Key SPC Techniques Used

X̄–R Charts
Detect variation and stability across samples

EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)
Detects subtle small shifts

CUSUM (Cumulative Sum Control Chart)
Great for early shift detection

Trend analysis for shapes: tapered, cylindrical, rectangular

Design + material integration insights

📈 Key Findings
Material Trends

Titanium shows the most stable processes

Carbon Fiber shows upward shifts requiring corrective actions

Aluminum shows early variation but stabilizes

Shape Trends

Tapered shapes are most stable

Cylindrical shapes show emerging shifts

Rectangular shapes are the most unstable and need intervention

Material + Shape Integration

Aluminum + Cylinder → tensile strength out of control → needs correction

Carbon Fiber + Rectangle → recovery trend but tensile strength still unstable
